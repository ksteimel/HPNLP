# High Performance Natural Language Processing

The HPNLP.org group consists mainly of enthusiasts, researchers, and students working on Natural
Language Processing (NLP), who are interested in High Performance NLP algorithms and applications.
The goal is to utilize modern technologies, e.g. GPUs, TPUs, distributed computation, to implement advanced
NLP algorithms, probabilistic, connectionist, symbolic, for new high performance hardware. We are interested
in miniaturization, mobile computing, and deep linguistic analysis.

Currently the group consists of faculty and students at Indiana University, and for Fall 2017 we intend to
have regular colloquium meetings in this domain.
